# TheC64BitcoinPriceMonitor

This project goal is create a current bitcoin price monitoring program for TheC64.

**The problem**: TheC64 does not support any network interface without hacking. 

**The idea**: Connect to the internet with an Arduino Leonardo, and emulate a keyboard/joystick and send the current price data to the program.

**Currently this is WIP!**

If you want to try it you need pull it and copy the KickAss assembler to assembler folder and the C64 debugger to the debugger folder. After that you can build it with the rebuild.sh.
